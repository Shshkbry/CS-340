## CS 340 Client/Server Development
**1. How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?**

>The use of whitespace is important to keep code readable and I make sure that all of the names I give to my modules and variables are brief, yet understandable. Keeping things fairly generic and modular makes my code easier to adapt in future projects. A CRUD module is a very basic resource that is used frequently.

**2. How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?**

>Thinking as a computer scientist means thinking in terms of systems, which I think is a good approach no matter the project.  It is necessary to think of each component as a smaller part of a larger cohesive whole. In future projects, I would spend more time on user experience. My dashboard looked pretty boring.

**3. What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?**

>Computer scientists use hardware and software to help individuals and organizations achieve their computational goals. They work to develop new ways, or improve upon old ways, of gathering and displaying data in a useful way and at a speed that humans cannot match. This kind of project can help a company learn from the data that is collected, which enables them to make more informed business decisions in the future.
